Setup of Ansible
--------------------
1 Create 3 or 4 AWS ubuntu 18 instances
2 NAme the 1st one as controller and remaining 2 as server1 and server2
3 Establish Passwordless ssh from Controller to Server1 and Server2
  a) Connect to server1 using gitbash
  b) Setup password for the default user
     sudo passwd ubuntu
  c) Edit the ssh configuration file
     sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
     Search for "PasswordAuthentication" and change it from no to yes
  d) Restart ssh
     sudo service ssh restart
     Repeat the above steps from a to d on Server2 managed node
  e) Connect to Controller using git bash
  f) Generate the ssh keys
     ssh-keygen
  g) Copy the ssh keys
     ssh-copy-id ubuntu@private_ip_of_server1
     Repeat step g with ipaddress of Server2

4 Installing Ansible
  a) Update the apt repository
     sudo apt-get update
  b) Install software-properties-common
     sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
  c) Add the latest version of Ansible to apt repository
     sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
  d) Update the apt repository
     sudo apt-get update
  e) Install ansible
     sudo apt-get install -y ansible

5 To check the verision of ansible
  ansible --version

Ansible stores all the remote servers info in a file called as inventory file
We should open this file and store the ipaddress of all the managed nodes here

sudo vim /etc/ansible/hosts
Here copy and paste the ipaddresses of the managed nodes
